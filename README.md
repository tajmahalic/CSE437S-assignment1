# CSE437S-assignment1
Tahj, Selam and Reis worked on this project.

The project is a 1 player Connect 4 game in which you play against the computer. The computer has two difficulty settings, easy and hard. 
A GUI is used to play our game and place pieces.

Tahj worked on the backend and the structure for our game.
Selam created the front-end and design of our game.
Reis made the JUnit tests and created the save/load feature.

User Tests:
1. If user tries to place a piece a full spot, console prints out an error message and the game freezes.
   To improve, we fixed this bug and made an error message.

2. User said that computer was too easy.
   To improve, we added a feature where you could select the computer difficulty (Easy/Hard).
   
3. After a player wins, the user could still continue to play connect four in the original window.
   We fixed this bug by graying out the move buttons after a player has won a game.
